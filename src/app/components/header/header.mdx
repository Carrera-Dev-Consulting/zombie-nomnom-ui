# Header

A Header is a component that can be used to render the main header on the page.

<Primary />

## Props 

<Controls />

## Stories

### Basic Header

You can set links and a title to render it on the page.

<Story of={HeaderStories.BasicHeader} />

### No Links

You can also just use it without having to define any links to render and it still looks good.

<Story of={HeaderStories.NoLinks} />
