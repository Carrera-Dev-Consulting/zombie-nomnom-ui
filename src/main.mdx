# Zombie NomNom UI

This is the interactive storybook to explore the UI components of the Zombie NomNom UI.

This is a place to mess around and explore ideas with how to style a thing without needing to have to render the whole page. 
However we will still let you render pages as expected if you want to see how all these pieces come together.

Please Explore our components and make any suggestions that you Think could help us improve!!

If you would like to learn how to add more stories please refer to existing *.stories.tsx or .mdx files for inspiration
and for more about the spec you can refer to [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) They have tons of tutorials that are nice and useful!.
